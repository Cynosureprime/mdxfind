### mdxfind vs hashcat vs john — 2.5M MD5 hashes

Contributed by @A1131. 2,500,000 32-character hex hashes, 200MB wordlist, Ubuntu 24.04.

| Tool | Hardware | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| **mdxfind** | Intel Core i5-9300H (CPU) | **26.0s** |
| john | RTX 1050 Ti (GPU) | 31.1s |
| hashcat | RTX 1050 Ti (GPU) | 56.9s |

mdxfind on a laptop CPU outperformed both GPU-accelerated tools on a mid-range GPU. This reflects mdxfind's architecture: it loads all hashes into a Judy array and tests every candidate against the entire hash set in a single pass, whereas hashcat and john are optimized for smaller hash lists with deeper iteration counts.

mdxfind's advantage grows with hash list size — the Judy array lookup is O(1) regardless of whether there are 1,000 or 100,000,000 hashes loaded.
